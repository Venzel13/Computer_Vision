This files contain scripts with 2 following tasks:
1. Aligning image (transform 1 image to another based on finding appropriate transformation automatically)
2. Object tracking (run the srcipt tracker.py. After running the web camera will be enabled and you see the square in the middle of the blurred video frame. Put the object you want to be tracked and press `whitespace`. The tracking will be started. Press `esc` for cancel)
