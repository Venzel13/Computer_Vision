Most of the CNN surveys (either from arxiv or PyTorch documentation https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html) of CNN models compare them by only accuracy. Obviously, this is not the only one criteria each data scientist should take into account. In order to compare different CNN architectures more proreply, I've created this benchmarks. Here each of the models compares by forward and backward time, memory usage and number of parameters. The code are located in .py files, results might be downloaded from benchmark.csv file and visualization is presented in Benchmark.ipynb file
